# MAX30003WING
Arduino codes ECG, Heartrate and RR Interval Data from MAX30003WING.

These codes are written by the author himself, taking help from the Internet plus Microsoft Copilot chat and some of the codebase has been used from [protocentral_max30003]([url](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_max30003)). Also got ideas from Analog Devices EngineerZone and NORDIC Semiconductor DevZone Q/A forum.
